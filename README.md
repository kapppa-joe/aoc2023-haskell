# AOC 2023 - Haskell

A place to store my (rather clumsy) attempts to solve AoC 2023 in Haskell.



Still have lots and lots to learn in Haskell, 
so probably the code would be quite messy and lengthy. Please bear with me :p

Might drop off mid-way (and switch to Python :D) if I find the puzzle of any day too hard for my current level.

Memo for my future self: 
 - examples and puzzle files are named like `01.txt`
 - use cabal, not stack. `just build` to grab dependencies
 - `just run src/Dayxx.hs`
 - using GHCup `0.1.20`, cabal `3.8.1`, GHC `9.4.7`, HLS `2.4.0`
